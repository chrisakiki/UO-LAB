* We started by creating a flow diagram of the process we are designing:

* We took a tour of the lab and looked and the equpment we will be using for our project

* We figured out the equations we need to use to solve for the different variables in our process

* We wrote some python code that calculates the head loss in the heat exchanger, the prossure drop

* First Trial: 25 ft 1" NPS pipe, 1hp Pump, 12A-40 Heat Exchanger, 1 electronic ball valve, 2 manual ball valves, 2 thermocouples, 1 flowmeter, 15 hr labor estimate, 1 T fitting, 4 elbows, 2 thermocouple fittings, 4 flanges, 1 tank
